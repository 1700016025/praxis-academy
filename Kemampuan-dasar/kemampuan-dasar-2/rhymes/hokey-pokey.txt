You put your right foot in,
You put your right foot out;
You put your right foot in,
And you shake it all about.
You do the Hokey-Pokey,
And you turn yourself around.
That's what it's all about!

You put your left foot in...
You put your right hand in...
You put your right side in...
You put your nose in...
You put your tail in...
You put your head in...
You put your whole self in...
